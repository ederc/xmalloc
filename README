Special purpose allocator for (eXtra-)small, same-sized memory (XMALLOC)
========================================================================

XMALLOC is a memory allocator for fast allocation and deallocation of lots of
small, same-sized memory chunks.

Note that XMALLOC is not meant to replace your system malloc, but it is
especially designed for applications with the above mentioned
allocation-behaviour.
