Special purpose allocator for (eXtra-)small, same-sized memory (XALLOC)
=======================================================================

XALLOC is a memory allocator for fast allocation and deallocation of lots of
small, same-sized memory chunks.

Note that XALLOC is not meant to replace your system malloc, but it is
especially designed for applications with the above mentioned
allocation-behaviour.
